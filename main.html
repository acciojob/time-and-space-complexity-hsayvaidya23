<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
  <p>Time complexity   
 refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size. An efficient algorithm has a low time complexity,   
 meaning it runs quickly even with large inputs.</p>
  <p><b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the input size. Often represented using Big O notation (e.g., O(n)), it measures the algorithm's memory efficiency.</p>
